CMD Files
=========

Just a couple of aliases for the commandline on Windows. I use a Mac at home and was always mixing things up.

* Easier navigation - `..` instead of `cd ..`.
* Unix style commands - `ls` instead of `dir`.
* `subl` shortcut for Sublime text.
* `server` shortcut to start a HTTP server for the current directory.

There are also a few shortcuts to a few directories I use a lot.
